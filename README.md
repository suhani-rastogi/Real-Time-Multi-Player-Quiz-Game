This project presents a well-structured and feature-rich multiplayer quiz game developed using Python. The system is built on a client-server architecture utilizing socket programming, allowing multiple users to participate simultaneously. It includes a secure login system that validates user credentials from a dedicated Credentials.txt file. Upon successful authentication, users can select from a wide range of quiz genres such as General Knowledge, Science, Mathematics, English, and Logical Reasoning, all stored in an Excel file categorized by sheets. Each quiz session presents randomly selected questions, and users interact with a GUI built using Tkinter, which ensures an intuitive and user-friendly experience. 
The application includes a countdown timer for each question, adding a layer of urgency and engagement. The server component manages incoming connections, delivers questions, receives user responses, and maintains score tracking throughout the session. The client-side handles topic selection, graphical interaction, and real-time communication with the server. Essential Python libraries like pandas and openpyxl are used for handling Excel data. This project serves as an excellent example of real-time application development in Python and can be extended further to include features like a persistent leaderboard, category-wise performance breakdown, encrypted authentication, or even a web-based version using Flask. It offers a compelling educational experience, showcasing the practical integration of networking, GUI, and data handling in a single cohesive system.
